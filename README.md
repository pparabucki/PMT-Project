Pseudo Color implemenatation

Using C++ I managed to implement PseudoColor  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_color#Pseudo_color ) algorithm that transforms grazscale pictures in colored pictures. 
Image is transformed from grayscale into RGB picture using  HSL transition and algorithm that I  developed specially for this application.
